Analytics

This data analysis is made up of timestamp, temperature and humidity data, spanning multiple days.

Given the type and range of the data, I chose to represent it in two forms - time series analysis and frequency distribution.
The time series analysis was represented by a scatterplot and line chart, where temperature and humidity occupied the y-axis and time on the x-axis
Time series analysis allows the comparison of two datapoints (temperature and humidity) in relation to time. This allows for any patterns to be easily recognised.
Frequency distribution was represented by a vertical histogram and a horizontal countplot.
Frequency distribution visualisations clearly display the most prominent datapoints in the dataset, allowing the reader to gague averages, standard deviations and ranges for the data.

I chose to use the Seaborn and Matplotlib Python libraries to create the data visualisations. I chose Seaborn because it is an easy to use library with an abundant amount of visualisation options.
Seaborn is built on top of the Matplotlib library, which allows for further customisation of visualisations, such as changing graph colours, scaling and titles.
